Java Design Patterns Project

This is the first version of the Java Design Patterns Project. 

I will include exercises for the videos I am uploading on Youtube for this project. 

Although I am using IntelliJ IDEA, any IDE should work just fine.

Please let me know if you identify anything that needs to be corrected, or if you have any other suggestions!
